# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

`lucuma-ts` (`@gemini-hlsw/lucuma-ts`) is a pnpm monorepo (`pnpm`, Node + corepack) of TypeScript apps and libs supporting GPP. Individual package names mix `navigate-*`, `lucuma-*`, and `resource-*` prefixes — don't assume a package's name from its folder.

TypeScript runs **directly under Node** (native type stripping) in dev — there's no ts-node and no build step before running. `configs` dev executes `.ts` files as-is (`node --watch ./src/index.ts`). All packages run their tests with Vitest.

Packages (under `packages/*`):

- **ui** (`@gemini-hlsw/navigate-ui`) — React 19 web UI to configure the telescope. PrimeReact + Tailwind v4, Jotai state, Apollo Client, react-router.
- **configs** (`@gemini-hlsw/navigate-configs`) — GraphQL backend (graphql-yoga) over a Postgres DB via Prisma. Serves the `/db` endpoint the UI talks to.
- **resource-ui** (`@gemini-hlsw/resource-ui`) — separate React web UI for Resource. The app reads **one** backend: the live Resource service at `/resource/graphql` (the vite proxy carries that path to the dev deployment purely to sidestep CORS). It does not serve the v1 API yet, so `pnpm resource-ui dev` shows a banner and empty views - that is expected, not a broken build. The package's `mock-server` backs the browser tests, codegen and GraphiQL on :4000; the app cannot be pointed at it (see `packages/resource-ui/CLAUDE.md`).
- **admin-ui** (`@gemini-hlsw/admin-ui`) — separate React web UI for the GPP Admin views (Programs, Users, Proposals, Change Requests, Calls for Proposals). Talks to the ODB and SSO GraphQL endpoints; codegen types under `src/gql/{odb,sso}/gen/`.
- **common-ui** (`@gemini-hlsw/lucuma-common-ui`) — shared code/utilities/test setup imported by `ui` and `resource-ui`.
- **e2e** (`@gemini-hlsw/navigate-e2e`) — Playwright end-to-end tests that run real `ui` + `configs` + a `navigate-server` docker image.

## Common commands

Root scripts proxy into packages via filters — e.g. `pnpm ui <script>`, `pnpm configs <script>`, `pnpm resource-ui <script>`, `pnpm e2e <script>`, `pnpm all <script>` (runs across all).

```bash
pnpm install                 # requires 'pnpm config set "//npm.fontawesome.com/:_authToken" "$FONTAWESOME_NPM_AUTH_TOKEN"' (FontAwesome Pro)

# UI dev
pnpm ui dev                  # vite dev server
pnpm ui codegen              # regenerate GraphQL types (run after changing any *.graphql or gql documents)
pnpm ui codegen:watch
pnpm ui build                # tsc -b && vite build (runs codegen via prebuild)
pnpm ui test                 # vitest — runs in a real browser (Playwright/chromium)

# configs (backend) dev
pnpm configs generate        # prisma generate
pnpm configs codegen         # graphql-codegen
pnpm configs dev             # node --watch with .env
pnpm configs test            # vitest integration tests in Node (spins up a Postgres testcontainer)

# resource-ui
pnpm resource-ui codegen           # regenerate src/gql/gen (gitignored) - needed before test/build on a fresh clone
pnpm resource-ui dev               # vite dev server (proxies /resource/graphql to the live dev service)
pnpm resource-ui dev:mock-server   # mock GraphQL server + GraphiQL on :4000 (predev hook runs codegen)
pnpm resource-ui test              # vitest - runs in a real browser (Playwright/chromium)
pnpm resource-ui build             # tsc -b && vite build (runs codegen via prebuild)

# lint (root, all packages)
pnpm lint                    # prettier --check + stylelint
pnpm <pkg> lint:eslint       # eslint per-package (eslint is configured per-package)
pnpm tsc:watch               # typecheck the whole build graph in watch mode

# e2e
pnpm e2e e2e:docker-up       # docker compose up the server stack
pnpm e2e test:e2e            # playwright test
```

Run a single test:

- UI/resource-ui (vitest): `pnpm ui test <path-or-name>` or `pnpm ui exec vitest run -t "<test name>" --brower.headless`. Prefer to use `--browser.headless` when running tests.
- configs (vitest, Node environment — no browser): `pnpm configs exec vitest run src/integration/<file>.test.ts` (Docker must be running for the Postgres testcontainer).

## Architecture

### GraphQL is the backbone — three separate schemas in the UI

The UI talks to **three distinct GraphQL endpoints**, each with its own generated types under `packages/ui/src/gql/{odb,server,configs}/gen/` (configured in `packages/ui/tasks/codegen.ts`):

- **odb** — schema from `@gemini-hlsw/lucuma-odb-schemas/odb` (the ODB / observation database; requires auth token).
- **server** — schema from `@gemini-hlsw/lucuma-apps-schemas/navigate` (the navigate command server, at `/navigate/graphql` + `/navigate/ws` for subscriptions).
- **configs** — schema is the local `packages/configs/src/**/*.graphql` files, served at `/db`.

All three are wired into a single Apollo Client in `packages/ui/src/gql/ApolloConfigs.ts`, which routes operations to the right endpoint via Apollo links (HTTP for queries/mutations, `graphql-ws` for subscriptions), injects the ODB auth token, and surfaces errors as PrimeReact toasts. The base server URIs are derived at runtime from `window.location.origin`.

**When you change a `.graphql` schema file or a gql document, you must re-run codegen** (`pnpm ui codegen` / `pnpm configs codegen`) or types will be stale. The `prebuild` script does this automatically on build; CI runs `codegen` and (for configs) `generate` before lint/test/build.

#### Custom scalars

The schemas define custom scalars (`ProgramId`, `GroupId`, `Timestamp`, `BigDecimal`, …). Each one needs an explicit TS mapping in the package's `tasks/codegen.ts` (`scalars`, per endpoint — e.g. `odbScalars`/`ssoScalars` in `packages/admin-ui/tasks/codegen.ts`); an unmapped scalar generates as `any`/`unknown` and every use of it becomes an unsafe cast.

**So: when you first select a field whose type is a custom scalar, add the scalar to `tasks/codegen.ts` and re-run codegen** — don't cast at the use site (`o.groupId as string`) and don't hand-write a local type. Most GPP id scalars map to `'string'`; `BigDecimal` is `'string | number'`.

### UI state: Jotai

App state lives in Jotai atoms under `packages/ui/src/components/atoms/` (auth token, server config, instrument, target, connection status, theme, etc.). A single shared store is created in `atoms/store.ts` and provided via `<Provider>` in `App.tsx`; non-React code (e.g. the Apollo links) reads/writes atoms directly through `store.get`/`store.set`. The app gates on loading `serverConfiguration` before rendering and retries on error.

### UI path aliases

`packages/ui/tsconfig.json` defines TS path aliases used throughout: `@/*` → `src/*`, plus `@gql/*`, `@Contexts/*`, `@Shared/*`, `@Telescope/*`, `@WavefrontSensors/*`, `@Guider/*`, `@assets/*`. Vite resolves these via `tsconfigPaths`. Prefer these aliases over deep relative imports, matching existing files.

### UI tests run in a real browser

Vitest is configured with the Playwright browser provider (`packages/ui/vite.config.ts`) — tests execute in chromium, not jsdom. Shared setup comes from `@gemini-hlsw/lucuma-common-ui/test/setup.ts`. Use `vitest-browser-react` for rendering. When running, prefer to add `--browser.headless` to Vitest. Also use `vitest run` or `vitest --no-watch` to make sure the process ends after a single test run.

When writing Vitest tests:

- **Test behavior, not implementation.** If the internals changed but the output stayed correct, the test shouldn't break. Render real components and drive them through real interactions (`userEvent`, or dispatch real `MouseEvent`/`TouchEvent`) rather than `renderHook` + calling returned handlers with hand-built fake event objects (`{ ... } as unknown as React.MouseEvent` is over-mocking). Assert on observable outcomes (rendered DOM, spy calls), not private state.
- **Never `sleep` to wait for state** — it's flaky and slow. Wait on the real thing: `await expect.element(locator).toBeVisible()/.toHaveTextContent(...)` or `expect.poll(() => ...)` (these retry on real timers — don't mix them with fake timers). To surface an async React commit for a test to await, reflect it in the DOM and wait on that.
- **Fake timers only for negative-timing assertions** (e.g. "this timer must _never_ fire"). Scope them to what's needed — `vi.useFakeTimers({ toFake: ['setTimeout', 'clearTimeout'] })` keeps React's scheduler real — advance with `vi.advanceTimersByTime(...)`, and restore with `vi.useRealTimers()` in `afterEach`.
- **Name `describe` blocks with the subject itself, not a string or `.name`.** When the subject is a function or component, write `describe(useSyncedState, ...)` / `describe(TopSubsystems, ...)` rather than `describe('useSyncedState', ...)` or `describe(useSyncedState.name, ...)` - the title follows a rename, and an identifier that stops resolving fails the typecheck where a stale string stays silent. `vitest/prefer-describe-function-title` makes both of the other forms an error.
- **Render helpers:** `render(...)` returns locators + `container` but **no `act`**; `renderHook(...)` returns `{ result, act, unmount }`. Use `sut.act(() => vi.advanceTimersByTime(...))` to flush timer-driven state updates when testing a hook directly.
- Use `vi.fn()`/`vi.mock()` (never the `jest` equivalents), recreate spies per test in `beforeEach`, and prefer real dependencies over mocks.

### configs backend

- **Prisma**: schema at `packages/configs/prisma/schema.prisma`; the client is generated into `packages/configs/src/prisma/gen/` (run `pnpm configs generate`). `src/prisma/extend.ts` extends the client; `src/prisma/queries/` holds query/seed logic (`populateDb`).
- **GraphQL**: schema split across `src/graphql/schema/*.graphql`; resolvers in `src/graphql/resolvers/{Query,Mutation}/`; generated resolver types in `src/graphql/gen/`. The yoga server is assembled in `src/server.ts` (`makeYogaServer`).
- **Server entry** (`src/index.ts`) runs a Node `cluster` with one worker per CPU; `node src/index.ts populate` seeds the DB instead of serving.
- **Integration tests** (`src/integration/*.test.ts`) use `@testcontainers/postgresql` to spin up a real Postgres per fixture (`src/integration/setup.ts` exposes an `executeGraphql` helper) — **Docker is required** to run them.

## Conventions

- ESLint flat config is **per-package** (extending root `eslint.config.shared.js`); run `pnpm <pkg> lint:eslint`. Root `pnpm lint` only covers Prettier + Stylelint.
- TS configs extend `@tsconfig/strictest`; the React compiler (`babel-plugin-react-compiler`) is enabled in the UI build.
- Import sorting is enforced (`eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort`); lint-staged + Prettier run on commit via Husky.
- Generated code (`**/gen/`, `src/prisma/gen/`) is not committed and should never be hand-edited — change the source schema/documents and re-run codegen.
- **Prefer Tailwind utility classes over (S)CSS styling when possible.** Reach for a `.css`/`.scss` file only for styles Tailwind can't express (e.g. complex selectors, keyframe animations, third-party component overrides).
- **Prefer the shared helpers in `packages/common-ui/src/functions.ts` over hand-rolled equivalents** (imported as `@gemini-hlsw/lucuma-common-ui` from `ui`, `admin-ui` and `resource-ui`): `isNullish`/`isNotNullish` instead of `x === null || x === undefined` (and as the `.filter()` predicate, since they're type guards), `when(x, …)` for an inline conditional without an else — especially conditional JSX — plus `cn` for Tailwind class merging, `round`, `formatDateTime`, `groupBy`, `parseNumber`. Only write the check by hand when the helper doesn't fit or reads worse; note that `when` also treats `false` as the false case, so it works for booleans too.
- **Prefer strict types from the schema (or other authoritative sources) over hand-written ones.** Derive from the generated types so a schema change surfaces as a compile error rather than silently drifting: select rows through fragments and use the generated fragment types; key label/lookup maps as `satisfies Record<Enum, …>` (or `Partial<Record<…>>` when the coverage is intentionally partial) over the generated enum; narrow with `Extract<…>` instead of re-declaring a union locally. Reach for a local type only when no operation selects the field (so codegen doesn't emit it) — and say so in a comment.

## CI & publishing

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) builds/lints/tests only changed packages (`...[origin/main]...` filters), runs the Playwright e2e job against a docker stack, and on tag push builds & publishes two docker images: `noirlab/gpp-nav-configs` (configs) and `noirlab/gpp-nav` (server + UI static files).

On a push to `main`, two further jobs deploy the standalone UIs to Firebase Hosting when their package (or a dependency) changed: `deploy-resource` publishes resource-ui to https://resource-dev.lucuma.xyz, and `deploy-admin` publishes admin-ui to https://admin-dev.lucuma.xyz. Each is gated by a package-specific `ci:set-deploy-flag` script, so a change to one can't trigger the other's deploy.
